%h1 Third Post: Google Analytics

%p
  Hello again from RubyRevealed! This is part 3 in a continuous series of blog posts that will guide you step by
  step in creating this very website. In this post, we'll learn about adding Google Analytics to our Rails app. If this
  is your first time here, please check out our
  = link_to 'second_post', '#second_post'
  or
  = link_to 'first post.', 'archive/first_post.html'

%p
  First things first, let's upgrade Rails to the latest version to avoid security vulnerabilities. Modify your Gemfile
  to reflect this:

%pre.prettyprint.lang-rb
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      gem 'rails', '3.2.13'

%p
  Then run:

%pre.prettyprint.lang-sh
  $ bundle update rails       # Ensure you are in the root directory of your Rails application

%p
  Okay, let's sign up for a Google Analytics account. Head over to
  = link_to 'their website', 'http://google.com/analytics'
  and sign in with your Google account. Simply fill out the form and click <b>Get Tracking ID</b>, and read through the
  terms of service (yes, we know you want to).

%p
  Now we need to add our Google Analytics tracker to our application. Paste this in <code>app/views/layouts/application.html.haml</code>
  right underneath the <code>= csrf_meta_tags</code>, remember to replace the UA and domain name with your own.

%pre.prettyprint.lang-js
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      :javascript
        (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
        (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
        m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
        })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

        ga('create', 'UA-xxxxxxxx-x', 'your-domain-name.com');
        ga('send', 'pageview');

%p
  Okay, now that this is in place, let's do some cleaning up. We want to ensure our readers can see this third post,
  but still have access to the first and second posts. Soon we'll be using a database, but for now, we are going to put
  our third post <b>Directly above</b> the second post, in the same file. So open up
  <code>app/views/application/index.html.haml</code> and paste in
  = link_to 'this code', '/archive/third_post.html.haml'
  at the very top, so it'll look like we have two posts in one.

%p
  To allow others to download this from your website, you'll also want to paste the third_post.html.haml contents into
  <code>public/archive/third_post.html.haml</code>
