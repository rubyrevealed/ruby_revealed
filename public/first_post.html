    <h2>A shared diary of a pair programming experiment</h2>

    <p>
      RubyRevealed is a story about how two friends, Adam Dalton and Andy Davis, developed this blog. 
      Ideally, if one were to follow this blog from start to finish at any time, you would have an exact
      copy of this site.

      <h3>So, let's dive right in</h3>

      <h4>DigitalOcean</h4>
      <p>
        It all starts with a Virtual Private Server (VPS). For this tutorial, we will be using the amazingly priced
        <a href="http://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> to host our website. Create an account and then proceed
        by creating a new Droplet. We set our hostname to be "rubyrevealed" and selected the following option.
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, next you need to select the desired region, we simply choose New York 1 since it was closer to us. Lastly
        select a droplet image. For this tutorial, we'll be using Ubuntu 12.10 x64 Server, shown below.
      </p>      

      <img src="/images/droplet_image.png" />

      <p>
        Once you click "Create Droplet" at the bottom, you will have your root password emailed to you in plain text. So it is
        strongly advised that you change it.
      </p>

      <pre>
        $ ssh root@[ip-address]
        $ passwd
        Enter new UNIX password:
        Retype new UNIX password:
        passwd: password updated successfully
      </pre>

      <p>
        Okay, let's install Vim, update our apt package database, and install the latest updates (if there are any).
      <p>

      <pre>
        $ apt-get install vim-nox
        $ apt-get update
        $ apt-get upgrade
      </pre>

      <p>
        If you see that a new kernel gets installed as part of the updates, you should reboot the system afterwards:
      </p>

      <pre>
        $ reboot
      </pre>

      <h4>Apache</h4>
      <p>
        Okay, time to install Apache. We will eventually be installing Ruby on Rails to build this blog, so we followed some of
        this <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RubyOnRails#Apache">Ubuntu community guide</a>.
      </p>

      <pre>
        $ sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev
      </pre>

      <p>
        Okay, if you own your own domain name, this is where we directed "rubyrevealed.com" to point to our new DigitalOcean server.
        We purchased the domain through DreamHost.com. We found this 
        <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean">How to Set Up a Host Name with Digital Ocean</a>
        guide pretty useful. Step 2 shows the Digital Ocean nameservers that you'll want to set at the place you registered your domain (DreamHost for us).
        Execute Step 3 and then you'll most likely just need to wait a few hours for the new nameservers to kick in.
      </p>

      <h4>HTML Time</h4>

      <p>
        In order to create this page, you'll want to modify the <pre>/var/www/index.html</pre> to look like the
        <a href="view-source:http://rubyrevealed.com/">source of this page (for Chrome and Firefox users)</a>
        For other browsers, just right click anywhere on the page and click "View Source".
      <p>

      <p>
        Feel free to also create a new directory <pre>/var/www/images</pre> to put your images in for now.
        You can download ours here: <br />
